        <div className="text-gray-800 font-light text-justify">
          <p className="mb-4">
            I am a highly skilled and motivated individual with a Bachelor of
            Science in Computer Science from the University of Iceland. My
            academic and practical experiences have equipped me with a strong
            foundation in programming, web development, and computer
            technologies.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            I am deeply passionate about computer architecture and programming,
            always eager to stay abreast of the latest technology trends and
            pursue new learning opportunities. My enthusiasm for technology is
            matched by my love for video gaming and commitment to physical
            fitness, reflecting my dedication to maintaining both mental and
            physical well-being.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            My strengths include a positive outlook, diligence, punctuality, and
            an energetic team spirit. I am adaptable, detail-oriented, and
            patient, qualities that I believe make me a valuable asset to any
            team. As I seek new opportunities in front-end development, I am
            excited to leverage my technical skills, passion for innovation, and
            collaborative spirit to contribute to a dynamic programming team. My
            portfolio and contributions to various projects are available for
            further exploration under the portfolio tab or on GitHub.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            I have proven my capabilities in real-world settings, particularly
            in my roles as a Web Developer for Hreyfisport K45 ehf and Orkustöð
            B20 ehf. In these positions, I was responsible for establishing an
            online store and designing and launching a website for a fitness
            center, respectively.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            My technical proficiency spans multiple programming languages,
            including Java, C, C++, C#, and Python, as well as web development
            technologies such as HTML, CSS, Sass, Tailwind, Styled Components,
            JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue.js, WebGL, Node.js, Next.js,
            Express.js, MongoDB, and WordPress. I am also experienced with R,
            SQL, PostgreSQL, Postman, Git, GitHub, Linux, Windows, Vim, Scene
            builder, Java Spring, Android Studio, and .Net.
          </p>

            Currently, I oversee smelter and furnace blending at Isal (Aluminum
            Factory) Rio Tinto, a role that has sharpened my problem-solving
            skills and ability to perform effectively under pressure. Working as
            a salesperson at Duty Free Iceland really highlighted my ability to
            handle various tasks and connect with a wide range of people, from
            colleagues to customers from all over the world.
